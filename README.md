## Hi there 👋

My name is Abdallah. I have almost 2 years of experience doing software professionally. I’m interested in backend engineering, systems engineering, and database systems. I mainly build using Golang, Python, TypeScript, and C. 

I love building data-heavy systems and squeezing every bit out of the tools. I also love open source; I’m mainly interested in contributing to network-related and cryptography systems. I push code to libssh using C. Here’s a list of my [MRs](https://gitlab.com/libssh/libssh-mirror/-/merge_requests/?sort=created_date&state=all&author_username=7adidaz&first_page_size=20).

You can check out my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g2y7osNEF6qcfLpV-AXmNVoArWwARCYm/view). 

Projects I’m proud of:
* [LSMTree](https://github.com/7adidaz/lsmtree)
* [XML to Python Dict in C language (paused)](https://github.com/7adidaz/xml2dict)
* [Playing around using fabric.js and Sockets](https://github.com/7adidaz/sharing-board)
* [Scrapes data about cities](https://github.com/7adidaz/Middle-East-Cities-Scraper)
